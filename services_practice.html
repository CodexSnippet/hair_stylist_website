			<p>I am a graduate of Empire Beauty School. A professional stylist for 3 years. I have a true passion for the art of hair. I use hair as my canvas, bringing a distinctive aesthetic and fresh approach to draw out each client’s unique beauty. “Hair is my art and I love the process of transforming someone from start to finish.”</p><br>
	<p>My mom was truly my inspiration. Watching and always eager to help her at her salon helped me understand at an early age that hair is not just an accessory; that great hair is the key to feeling beautiful inside and out. I knew then that I wanted a part in helping people feel beautiful. I then started my journey to mastering skills in cutting, coloring, styling and extensions.</p><br>
<p>“I love hair and feel incredibly blessed that I’ve found a career that resonates with me so perfectly. As a stylist I believe in honesty, patience, creativity and hard work all functioning together to produce a beautiful end result for my clients.”</p>
